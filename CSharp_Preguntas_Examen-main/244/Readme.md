Explanation
Explanation/Reference:**

Explanation:
Use a lambda expression in a method-based query by using the Enumerable.Where standard query operator.
.Equals() is intended to communicate value equality — do the two probably different object instances referred to
by the two variables have the same value, for some definition of "same" that you provide by overloading the
method.
Incorrect:
Not A: For reference types, == is intended to communicate reference equality — do the two variables refer to
the same object instance.
